      <h1>Welcome to the Empirical Research Study</h1>
      <h2>
        Impact of Programming Paradigms: Functional Programming vs.
        Object-Oriented Programming on Development Speed using JavaScript
      </h2>

      <p>
        In this survey, we have included a series of programming tasks followed
        by a questionnaire. This research is undertaken by students from
        'Technische Universit√§t Chemnitz' as part of an academic research
        project.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your participation in this survey is vital, as it greatly contributes to
        our understanding of empirical research and helps shape our project.
      </p>

      <h2>Goal of the Survey:</h2>
      <p>
        The main goal of this research is to acquire and implement suitable
        empirical research techniques through an analysis of the influence of
        programming paradigms on development speed. As a result, you will be
        given a designated coding task to solve using JavaScript, focusing on
        either the Functional Programming or Object-Oriented Programming
        paradigm.
      </p>

      <h2>Anonymity/Privacy:</h2>
      <p>
        Rest assured that all personal information collected during this survey
        will be kept confidential and used for research purposes only. Your
        personal details will not be disclosed to any third party.
      </p>

      <h2>Relevant Instructions:</h2>
      <p>
        As you proceed with the coding tasks, please note that this survey does
        not provide a code compiler. You are encouraged to use any code editor
        of your choice, such as VS Code, for compiling the code. Additionally,
        you may use the internet to access relevant coding syntax or formulas.
        However, it is essential to refrain from using any AI tools, such as
        ChatGPT, to directly obtain answers. The purpose is to evaluate coding
        skills and problem-solving abilities without external assistance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your participation in this study is estimated to take a maximum of 45
        minutes. Your contribution plays a crucial role in the success of our
        research.
      </p>

      <h2>Feedback:</h2>
      <p id="feedback-section">
        If you encounter any issues or have feedback regarding the survey,
        please make a note of it in the provided feedback section.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thank you for your participation in our research study. Your valuable
        input significantly contributes to helping us understand empirical
        research techniques better. If you have any questions or concerns, feel
        free to contact me.
